# 👋 Hi, I'm ShubhRaj

🎓 I'm a BCA undergrad diving deep into Python and programming fundamentals — one project at a time.

💻 Currently working with:
- Python (my main squeeze 🐍)
- Git & GitHub for version control
- Basic HTML/CSS (no JS!)

🌱 Learning goals:
- Master Python syntax, modules, and OOP
- Build Python CLI tools, scripts, and mini projects
- Explore Data Structures and Algorithms

🎯 2025 Dev Goals:
- Upload at least 5 Python projects
- Contribute to open-source
- Build a Python portfolio that pops!

⚡ Fun fact:
Most of my bugs are just missing colons... 😅
